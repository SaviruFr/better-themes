# Getting Started

This is a test documentation page to show how **better-themes** works. better-themes is a framework-agnostic theming solution for React applications. It provides seamless dark mode support with zero flash on load, system preference detection, and cross-tab synchronization.

## Features

- **Zero flash on load** - Prevents theme flash during page load (SSR/SSG safe)
- **System preference detection** - Automatically detects and respects user's system theme preference
- **Cross-tab synchronization** - Theme changes sync across browser tabs and windows
- **Framework agnostic** - Works with Next.js, Remix, Vite, TanStack Start, Waku, and more

## Quick Start

Wrap your app with `ThemeProvider`:

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { ThemeProvider } from "better-themes/rsc";

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class">
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```
